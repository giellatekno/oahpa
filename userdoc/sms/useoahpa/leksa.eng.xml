    <p>Word quizes are not only fun, but useful for training vocabulary. The game
        <strong>Leksa</strong> is meant for pupils who are learning Skolt Sámi, perhaps also for
      pupils in need of writing practice. The program accepts synonyms, so that "toll" can be
      translated as both "fire", "campfire" and "bonfire". Let us know if synonyms are missing! </p>

    <p><strong>Options</strong>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>From Skolt Sámi to English/Finnish/Norwegian/Russian or from
        English/Finnish/Norwegian/Russian to Skolt Sámi.</li>
      <li>Words: You can restrict the vocabulary, and choose a text book or a subject.</li>
      <!--<li>If you choose "Multi-word expression" in the menu, you must write at least two Sami words,
        e.g. "kärŋilis tääsi"</li>-->
      <li>Names: You may choose between place names and person names.</li>
      <!--Place names: You can restrict the geographical range of the place names ("Sápmi" or "World"). You can also restrict the place names according to frequency ("common" or "rare").
</li>
-->
    </ul>

    <p>In <strong>Leksa</strong>, we want the users to practice everyday language, and the game is
      based on words which are used in beginner courses, with additions from primary school
      textbooks. You can read more about this on the Oahpa-vocabulary page. We can add lists of
      place names from your area, and we can also make teaching aids for specific subjects, such as
      sami handicraft (ǩiõttʼtuẹjj). Feel free to contact us if you have suggestions (oahpa@hum.uit.no). </p>
