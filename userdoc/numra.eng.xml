    <title>Numra</title>
  </header>

  <body>
    <p><strong>Numra</strong> is a program for practicing numerals. We recommend Numra to all students of Sámi: In order to learn a language you must know its numeral system.</p>

<p><strong>Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>- Range: 0-10, 0-20, 0-100 or 0-1000.</li>
<li>- Mode: From number to numeral, and from numeral to number.</li>
<li>- Ordinal numbers.</li>
</ul>


<p>Numra differs from the other games in that is also has versions for South, Lule, Inari and Kildin Sámi. It can be interesting for students to compare the different Sámi languages.</p>

<p>The program is still being developed, but is now available for testing. Feel free to send us corrections and suggestions for improvement (oahpa@hum.uit.no).</p>
