    <p>With the Vasta program you are supposed to give answes to random questions. The purpose of the exercise is to train verb inflection and case usage. The program will accept several answer alternatives, and give comments to deviant inflection or case usage.</p>

    <p>The program requires that one answer in full sentences ( they must contain a finite verb). If the question contains the pronoun "we", you are supposed to answer with "you", not with (inclusive) "we", and the same goes for the dual forms. The goal, again, is not to simulate natural conversation ("should we go now? - Yes, we should"), but to train all subject-verb combinations, rather than repeating input. </p>
 
 <section><title>Options: Levels</title>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Only present tense and basic case usage, mostly in singular.</li>
<li>Level 1-2: Also past tense and more cases in plural and also oblique cases.</li>
<li>Level 1-3: Case inflection of numerals, collective numbers, verbs in conditionalis.</li>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

    <p>Grammar explanations to the user are not ready yet, but they are forthcoming.</p>
    

<p>The program is still at beta stage. At this stage all the comments from the program will be given in Norwegian, but we are soon going to implement Saami as a meta language as well. We would like to receive comments and feedback, to the address: (oahpa@uit.no). </p>
