The [Oahpa end user documentation|http://oahpa.no/] is
built by forrest.

The files are stored in {{ped/userdoc}}. Files stored there will be
included in the forrest build __if they are linked to__ from one of
the files {{index.xml, tabs.xml, site.xml}} in {{ped/userdoc}}.

The forrest build system will then move the linked catalogues and
files to the relevant catalogue on the gtoahpa site.

(The folder is public_html under oahpa).
