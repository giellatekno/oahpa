!!!The goal of the project

The goal is to offer the Oahpa programs for students of Russian



!!!Russian and Oahpa

!!Oahpa

Oahpa has 6 programs, they can be divided in three groups

# Learn words
## __Leksa__: basic words and place names
## __Numra__: numerals, time and date
# Learn inflection
## __Morfa-S__: Inflect words
## __Morfa-C__: Inflect words in sentential context
# Learning to write sentences
## __Vasta__: Answering to questions
## __Sahka__: Chatting with the computer

The programs are best developed for [North Sami Oahpa|http://oahpa.no/davvi].

In order to get working programs for learning inflection one needs
a morphological transducer. There is one in the making within the Apertium
framework, it can be found here:

In order to get the programs for sentence writing one needs morphological
and syntactic disambiguators. These are still missing for Russian.
