<h1>About VIEW</h1>

<div class="text">

<p>VIEW is an intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL) 
system designed to provide supplementary language learning
activity resources to language learners. It can be viewed as an intelligent 
automatic workbook, providing an unlimited 
number of activities designed to foster awareness of grammatical 
forms and functions. Because it is a web-based system, it can be used anywhere
there is a computer with internet access.</p>

<p>The VIEW activities are automatically derived from authentic 
texts, obtained from any web page of interest. The task of retrieving
texts appropriate for learners is handled by a separate 
<a href="http://drni.de/zap/ir4ll">Information Retrieval for Language Learning</a> (IR4LL) project.
</p>

<p>VIEW uses state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP)
technology to generate exercises, identifying 
targeted lexical and phrasal material through a combination 
of tokenization, lemmatization, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, 
chunking, and parsing.</p>

<p>The activity types VIEW provides follow a pedagogically motivated
progression from receptive presentation, to productive
presentation, to controlled practice. Specifically, activities 
include the coloring of targeted forms,
having the learner find and click on targeted forms, and finally, 
controlled practice activities such as multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, 
or editing tasks.  VIEW provides these activity progressions for a 
variety of grammar topics.</p> 

<h2>VIEW History</h2>

<p>VIEW is a multilingual extension of the <a href="http://purl.org/icall/werti">WERTi 
system</a> (Working with English Real Texts), which has been under development since 2006.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://purl.org/icall/werti-v1">original WERTi system</a> was designed by 
<a href="http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~dm/">Detmar Meurers</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~vmetcalf/">Vanessa Metcalf</a>, 
<a href="http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/amaral1/">Luiz Amaral</a>,
Chris Kovach, and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/coryshain">Cory Shain</a>
at Ohio State University.  Work on WERTi continued at the 
<a href="http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de">University of T&uuml;bingen</a>
after Detmar moved there in 2008.  The original Python-based code was ported
to Java and the UIMA framework by <a href="http://github.com/adimit">Aleksandar Dimitrov</a> 
and developed further by <a href="http://www.drni.de/niels/">Niels Ott</a>
and <a href="http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~rziai/">Ramon Ziai</a>.  A demo of the 
<a href="http://purl.org/icall/werti-v2">first Java version</a> is available for reference.
In 2010, <a href="http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~adriane/">Adriane Boyd</a> developed the
firefox extension, which improves usability and compatibility, in particular for 
web pages with dynamically-generated content and special session handling.
</p>
<p>
We are continually working on new topics and activities and are grateful for ideas and contributions in this
area from Magdalena Leshtanska, Emma Li, Iliana Simova, Maria Tchalakova, and Tatiana Vodolazova.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>North Saami version of VIEW</strong> has been set up by <a mailto="heli1401@gmail.com">Heli Uibo</a>. The exercise types (topics) have been worked out by Lene Antonsen.
